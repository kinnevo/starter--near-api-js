I tested using 

Vercel -- https://vercel.com/dashboard 
Fleek  -- https://fleek.co/ 
Local in Visual Studio Code using a local server: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52583550/steps-to-run-node-http-server-in-visual-studio-code

To run server once it was installed use:

npm start

this open a home page that allows to test locally
the same should work in vercel and fleek

I all cases you need to open the "inspect" function of the browser to watch the results in the Console
